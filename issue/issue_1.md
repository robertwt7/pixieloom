## Acceptance Criteria

- A user can create a new account.
- A user can log in with their credentials.
- A user can log out.
- The main application page is protected and only accessible to logged-in users.
- The header displays the user's authentication status with appropriate links (Login/Signup or Logout).
- All new code follows the existing project structure and coding style.
- The implementation is documented in `docs/plan_1.md`.
